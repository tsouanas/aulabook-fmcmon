TIPS

1. To cite a reference, use \cite{refname}.
   (There must be a corresponding entry with refname in refs.bib.)

2. To add a reference, use google to find its BibTeX entry, and add it
   to the file refs.bib.  Make sure to modify it if needed so that it is
   consistent with the rest of the entries.  You should most probably
   change its identifier (first field), to something easier-to-remember.

3. Use \topic{topic name} in the exercises to highlight use of a certain
   topic (this also places it in the index).
   Use ! to introduce sub-topics:
   \topic{induction!mutual}
   It's best to put these commands on a new line each,
   and end each such line with a comment, like that:
   \topic{set theory}%
   \topic{cardinality}%

4. Define your personal macros in the file TEACHERmac.tex,
   where TEACHER is your teacher handle, and put it inside content/.
   These macros will only be available to YOUR lesson files.

5. Define general math macros in mathmac.tex.
   They will be available to everyone.
